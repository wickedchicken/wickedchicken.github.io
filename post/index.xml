      <description>I recently got a new Macbook, and began setting up the Nix package manager to install my developer toolset. I mainly did this to try and have a working setup without installing Homebrew. Since I ran into a few issues, I wanted to briefly document what I did and why in case others wanted to try the same.
Why Nix? (and why not Homebrew or MacPorts?) The short answer: hype.</description>

      <description>After 2 years of learning German I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that, for the most part, you can go a long way by mapping foreign concepts to ones that you already know. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;ve had success mapping aspects of German grammar to programming concepts I use every day. After all, programmers deal with weird grammars all the time, why not take advantage of that skill?
Gendered nouns: forward error correction Probably the first difficulty people run into when leaning German is memorizing the gender of each noun and properly declining that noun&amp;rsquo;s articles when used in a sentence.</description>
